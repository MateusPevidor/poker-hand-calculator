## How to run
`npm i` to download dependencies

`npm run dev` to start the typescript transpiler

open the `index.html` file inside dist/ to run on your browser (I had plans to make things visual)

you can install ts-node-dev to run inside node (no browser)

you can open with live server on vscode to get hot reload
